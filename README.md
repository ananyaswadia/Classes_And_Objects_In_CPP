# Classes_And_Objects_In_CPP
### Aim
To study and implement classes and objects in C++.
## Tools 
Visual Studio Code
## Theory
### What is Object Oriented Prograamin (OOPs)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design computer programs.OOPs promotes code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility, particularly for large and complex projects, by using concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
### Classes
A class is a template to create objects having similar properties and behavior, or in other words, we can say that a class is a blueprint for objects.
A class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions that can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.
### Objects
An object is an instance of a class. For example, the animal type Dog is a class, while a particular dog named Tommy is an object of the Dog class.
Objects are the actual entities that are created as an instance of a class. There can be as many objects of a class as desired.
