# Classes_And_Objects_In_CPP
### Aim
To study and implement classes and objects in C++.
## Tools 
Visual Studio Code
## Theory
### What is Object Oriented Prograamin (OOPs)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design computer programs.OOPs promotes code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility, particularly for large and complex projects, by using concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
### Classes
A class is a template to create objects having similar properties and behavior, or in other words, we can say that a class is a blueprint for objects.
A class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions that can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.
### Objects
An object is an instance of a class. For example, the animal type Dog is a class, while a particular dog named Tommy is an object of the Dog class.
Objects are the actual entities that are created as an instance of a class. There can be as many objects of a class as desired.

## Algorithms
### Create a class car and its related objects
1. Start.

2. Define a class Car with attributes: brand and year.

3. Declare an array of Car objects.

4. For each car, Input brand and year.

5. Display brand and year.

6. End.
### Calculate area and volume of cube
1. Start.

2. Define class Area with members: length, width, height.

3. Input length, width, and height.

4. If length = width → print "Cube", else print "Cuboid".

5. If length or width < 0 → print error.

6. Else calculate and display area = length × width.

7. Calculate and display volume = length × width × height.

8. End.
### Volume of cube using methods inside and outside the class 
1. Start.

2. Define class Cube with members: height, width, length.

3. Inside the class, define: volume_in() → calculates and prints volume (length × width × height).

4. Declaration of volume_out().

5. Define volume_out() outside the class → calculates and prints volume.

6. Input height, width, and length.

7. Call volume_in() (inside method).

8. Call volume_out() (outside method).

9. End.
### Cube volume (public and private objects)
1. Start.

2. Define class Cube with private data members: length, width, height.

3. Define a public function volume() that calculates and returns length × width × height.

4. Create an object of Cube.

5. Call volume() and display the result.

6. End.
## Conclusion 
We learn basics of OOPs , classes , objects and class methods in C++.
